## Objective: Develop a brain-computer interface system that enables wheelchair control using thoughts as command inputs.
- Disassembled an e-wheelchair controller and soldered its test points to an Arduino Nano.
- Trained mental commands using an EMOTIV Insight headset and converted them into movement inputs.
- Presented our prototype at the Aggies Create Innovation Expo and placed 1st out of 20 teams!
- Currently transitioning to testing this product with prospective users.
